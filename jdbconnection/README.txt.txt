HOW TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK

-Take the jar (driver file) and stick it in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_21 
   (Im sure the file will work fine from any folder, I just like the cleanliness of the class folder on my pc)
-Then start up NetBeans and open the project
-on the left hand side make sure the "Projects" tab is selected 
-right click on the main project name go down to properties
-Once properties is clicked a new window will appear on the lefthand side click on Libraries
-on the far right click "Add JAR/Folder"
-Navagate to the JAR file and click open
-Click OK

thats it.
